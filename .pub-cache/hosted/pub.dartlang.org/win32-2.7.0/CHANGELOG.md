## 2.7.0

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Major work on Windows Runtime APIs, with huge thanks to
  Halil İbrahim Durmuş (@halildurmus). Breaking changes are limited to WinRT
  APIs, which are now more idiomatic for Dart. Includes full implementation of
  System.Globalization.Calendar that is the new reference design for WinRT APIs.
- Restructure generation code into a separate package in tool\generator.
- Use super parameters introduced in Dart 2.17, with matching dependency
  upgrade.
- Tidy up examples to include consistent headers.
- All files now have lower case names (e.g. IUnknown.dart -> iunknown.dart)

## 2.6.1

- Improve pana compliance

## 2.6.0

- Add support for returning vectors from Windows Runtime APIs (#406, thanks to
  @halildurmus)

  equivalents (#418, thanks to @halildurmus)
- Add additional documentation on Windows Runtime APIs
- Update IDispatch sample to show how to supply parameters

- Fix an error with strings in structs (#425, thanks to @postacik)
- Update contributor documentation

## 2.5.2

- Add example for monitor EDID data (#393, thanks to @krjw-eyev)
- Expand Bluetooth example (#397, thanks to @Sunbreak)
- Fix a comment typo (#398, thanks to @gaddlord)

- Add example for an owner-draw (custom) titlebar
- Add new Wbem WMI interfaces
- Add example of WMI high-performance counters
- Add new theming APIs
- Update to latest Windows metadata (with a couple of minor changes to signed
  ints in MOUSEDATA and send()).

## 2.5.1

- Add GetProcessTimes (#396, thanks to @halildurmus)
- Add device interface and device class GUIDs
- Add examples for Bluetooth LE and Setup APIs (#390, #392, thanks to @Sunbreak)
- Fix setup APIs to project HDEVINFO correctly

## 2.5.0

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Use new projection tooling for WinRT classes. WinRT APIs are
  still in development and should be considered experimental; expect volatility
  as the projection tools mature and map types like String and DateTime, as well
  as WinRT primitives such as IVectorView, onto their Dart equivalents. (This
  doesn't affect COM and Win32 APIs, which can largely be considered stable,
  with the exception of changes to the underlying metadata exposed by
  Microsoft.)
- Add setupapi APIs, which were not being successfully projected. (#383, with
  thanks to @Sunbreak.) Add test to prevent that happening again.
- Add additional setup APIs (#386, with further thanks to @Sunbreak).
- Remove `tools/` folder from published package to reduce download overhead.

## 2.3.11

- Add gamepad APIs

## 2.3.10

- Add DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT enum values.

## 2.3.9

- Add a few minor constants and handle typedefs. Nothing to see here.

## 2.3.8

- Update package:ffi minimum version to 1.1.0, allowing use of arena
- Hide `Char` within generated structs.g.dart in prep for new FFI feature.

## 2.3.7

- Declare platform support using new `platforms:` declaration in pubspec.yaml
- Update minimum version to Dart 2.15.0 and use constructor tearoffs

## 2.3.3

- Added CreateThread, CreateRemoteThread, CreateRemoteThreadEx() per request
- Added GetMachineTypeAttributes and added logic for Windows 11.

## 2.3.2

- Upgraded to latest published Windows metadata from Microsoft, which modifies
  the signature of some registry-related APIs from Int32 to Uint32 for better
  accuracy with the original API.
- Updated to the latest code generator, ported back from the v3 code.

## 2.3.1

- Use automatic code generator for most structs. This may be a breaking change
  if you use the Bluetooth APIs, since `BLUETOOTH_ADDRESS.rgBytes` is now an
  `Array<Uint8>` instead of a `List<int>`. This is more accurate, but will
  require minor code change.
- Add additional raw input constants

## 2.3.0

- Completely overhauled the metadata generation tooling (tools\projection
  directory). The code is much better structured, with each layer (type ->
  parameter -> method -> class) in its own `___Projection` class. Fixed a number
  of errors in the process, such as the assumption that all enums are of type
  `Uint32`.
- Rewrote several complex structs to use the new `Union` FFI type introduced in
  Dart 2.14 (and updated the minimum version accordingly). Code that uses the
  `INPUT` struct will need to be slightly modified, since the `mi`/`ki`/`hi`
  fields are now nested rather than provided as an extension property.
- Cleaned up some COM `Pointer` types to be more explicit.
- Add raw input APIs
- Add low-level keyboard hooks example

## 2.2.10

  app in example\explorer)

  a new sample for enumerating locally installed printers.

## 2.2.2

- Add Windows Spooler library support.

## 2.2.1

- Add initial support for the Windows Socket library (winsock2).

## 2.2.0

- Fixes convertToHString to return an int, since `HSTRING`s are handles. This is
  a breaking change for any apps that use WinRT APIs, but given the limited
  availability of WinRT classes that fall into this category, updating only the
  minor version.
- Add low-level Device IO and structured storage APIs and diskinfo.dart sample.

## 2.1.5

- Add smart card reader support.

## 2.1.4

- Add helper functions for COM along with extra documentation.

  enables support for more automated generation of structs, which in turn
  increases development velocity for this package.

  - More complete Bluetooth support
  - MIDI support
  - High DPI support
  - `IDispatch` support
  - Many more core user32 APIs

## 2.0.5

  sample (`dump.dart`).

  structs automatically using this metadata.

  breaking change, but it's not anticipated to be a problem since these classes
  are only used for code generation.
